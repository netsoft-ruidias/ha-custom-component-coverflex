# Coverflex Benefits Integration
Coverflex Benefits - Custom Component for Home Assistant

The data source for this integration is the [Coverflex Benefits](https://www.coverflex.com/).

The author of this project categorically rejects any and all responsibility for the card balance and other data that were presented by the integration.

# Installation
## HACS (Recommended)
This integration can be added to HACS as a custom (non-default) repository.

Assuming you have already installed and configured HACS, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the HACS integrations page
2. Choose Integrations under HACS
3. Click the '+' button on the bottom of the page
4. Serch for "Coverflex", choose it, and click install in HACS
5. Ready! Now continue with the configuration.

## Configuration Through the interface
1. Navigate to `Settings > Devices & Services` and then click `Add Integration`
2. Search for `coverflex`
4. Enter your credentials
5. Repeat the procedure as many times as desired to include other cards you may have

# Presentation

To present your data (card balance) just use a any entity card

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - sensor.coverflex_card_firstName_lastName_pocketType
```

## Transactions

While showing the card's balance on a card is commonplace (any entity card will do), displaying transactions can be more complicated to achieve.

We recommend using [custom:list-card](https://github.com/iantrich/list-card) which has the advantage of being able to indicate the number of rows to display:

```yaml
type: custom:list-card
entity: sensor.coverflex_card_firstName_lastName_pocketType
feed_attribute: transactions
title: My Coverflex Transactions
row_limit: 10
columns:
  - title: Data
    field: date
  - title: Movimento
    field: description
  - title: Valor
    field: amount
    postfix: ' €'
    style:
      - text-align: right
      - white-space: nowrap
```
